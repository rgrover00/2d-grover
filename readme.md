# 🎮 2D Grover Journey

Welcome to **2D Grover Journey** – my interactive portfolio built like a video game!

Instead of just reading a boring list of projects, you get to **walk around, click things, and explore my world**. Think of it like Pokémon meets a digital résumé.

This is a website where you:

* 👆 Tap or click the screen to move around.
* 💬 Talk to objects (like my computer, books, or TV) to learn about me.
* ❌ After reading a menu, click **Close** to keep exploring.
* 🎉 Have fun while learning what I do as a Network Engineer and Developer!

## 🛠 Built With

* [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) – game engine for the 2D world
* HTML / CSS – makes the text and style look nice
* JavaScript – makes the world come alive

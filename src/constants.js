  pc: `Welcome to my PC—my hub for all things tech (and occasionally trying to game when life allows). Here, I solve networking problems, pretend to code, and work on self-hosted projects.

  "sofa-table": "This is my sofa, where I pretend to relax while spending time with my wife, Stinabean, and keeping up with our three little adventurers—Ayla (4), Bryson (2), and baby Everly. It’s also where I brainstorm self-hosted web projects or unwind after a garage gym workout. Curious about my work?

  tv: 
  `This is our family TV with three little ones it’s become more of a learning tool than an entertainment hub. From colorful animations that teach letters and numbers to fun science experiments and music, it’s all about keeping the kids engaged while sparking their curiosity.

  Occasionally, when the chaos settles, I’ll use it to catch up on tech YouTubers or Twitch streams—but let’s be honest, the kids run the programming most of the time!`,

  bed: "This is my relaxation chair—or at least, that’s what I call it. In reality, it’s where I pretend to relax while keeping an eye on my three little ones: Ayla (4), Bryson (2), and baby Everly. Between coding projects, managing systems, and the wonderful chaos of parenting, this spot serves as my unofficial command center for multitasking. On rare occasions, I actually get to sit here uninterrupted, brainstorming new ideas, catching up on tech content, or just taking a breather. But let’s be honest, with three kids, relaxation is more of a concept than a reality!",

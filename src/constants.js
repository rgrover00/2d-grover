"pc":  
"This is my big computer! It’s like my toolbox. I use it to fix the internet and make cool things on the screen. You know how you use crayons to draw pictures? I use my keyboard to draw computer puzzles. Sometimes I even play games when I have extra time!",  

"cs-degree":  
"On my wall, I have special awards—like shiny gold stars! They show I worked really hard to learn about computers and the internet. I even learned about computer ‘clouds’—not the fluffy ones in the sky, but the kind that help phones, TVs, and iPads talk to each other.",  

"sofa-table":  
"This is my cozy couch! I sit here with Miss Stinabean and our three silly kids—Ayla (she’s 4, just like some of you!), Bryson (he’s 2), and baby Everly. We watch cartoons, laugh, and rest together. It’s like our family charging station—where we all power up with hugs!",  

"tv":  
"This is our TV. It’s not just for cartoons—it teaches letters, numbers, songs, and even fun science like volcanoes! Sometimes I use it to learn new computer tricks. But most of the time, guess what? The kids pick the shows!",  

"bed":  
"This is where I try to rest. Sometimes I read or think of new computer ideas. But with three kids, it usually turns into a tickle fight or a pillow mountain! Even grown-ups need quiet time… even if it doesn’t last long!",  

"resume":  
"This is my desk. On it, I have a big paper about me—it’s like a grown-up show-and-tell! It shows what I can do, what tools I use, and the jobs I’ve done. When I want to work on new projects, I share it so people know I can help—like hanging artwork on the fridge!",  

"projects":  
"This adventure you’re playing is a game I made! I built it using something called Kaboom—it’s like a box of digital Legos. I tell the computer how to build the world, and it brings it to life. Just like you stack blocks to make a tower, I stack code to make a game!",  

"library":  
"These are my books. They’re full of computer puzzles and secrets! Some teach me how the internet works, some how to make websites, and some how to keep computers safe. I don’t read them all because I’m busy playing, but they remind me learning never stops!",  

"exit":  
"Look for what you can't see... Sometimes the best things are the ones you can’t see—like Wi-Fi! Almost like magic.",
